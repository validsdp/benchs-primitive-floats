# Benchmarks for primitive-floats in Coq

This repo gathers benchmarks accompanying the
[primitive-floats](https://github.com/validsdp/coq/tree/primitive-floats)
implementation of `binary64` floating-point arithmetic in Coq.

See the `README.md` in the
[random\_posdef\_matrices/matrices](https://github.com/validsdp/benchs-primitive-floats/tree/master/random_posdef_matrices/matrices#readme)
subdirectory for more details.
